Dear Sir,

　　On behalf of 【the Students' Union】, I am writing to invite you to be 【a judge for the upcoming English speech contest】, which will be held 【at 5 p.m. on April 22】【in the Auditorium of our university】.

　　【During the competition, the judges are expected to fairly evaluate each competitor's performance and give an objective mark accordingly, based on which the final top three will be awarded. In the end all participants will be invited to take some group photos.】

　　Since your are known as one of the best 【foreign teachers】, your presence and judgement would be of great importance. Hopefully you would be interested to join us. We are looking forward to you reply.
