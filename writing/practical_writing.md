Dear Mr. Wang,

　　I am very grateful to have been employed as an editor for your magazine *Design & Fashions* for the past two months. I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with all my passionate colleagues. And the wonderful experiences I had here are the ones that I will never forget.However, I am sorry that I have to quit this job.

　　As a young man whose primary major is computer science, I have found that my present position does not fit in with my previous training. Therefore I have decide to leave and try to pursue other chances that may better conform to my educational background.

　　Please accept my sincere apology for any possible inconvenience.
