Dear **Sir or Madam**,

　　**Moved by the noble spirit of** Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved so far, I **would like** to contribute my effort by offering financial aid to a child in the project.

　　I **would be** very grateful if you **could** help me **seek out a girl who** has just started primary school but whose family cannot afford her education.

　　**My plan is to** pay for her tuition on an annual basis until she finishes her secondary education. I **would like** to remit my donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area. I am looking forward to your prompt reply.
