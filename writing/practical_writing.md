Dear **Sir or Madam**,

　　I am a university student and I always spend my spare time in the library. **Generally speaking, the services offered here are quite good. However, I have some suggestions for your consideration.**

　　**Firstly, will you please** renew the old air conditioners? It is annoying that they usually produce big noise. **Secondly**, some of the books on the shelves are out of date. It would be of great help if you could provide us with some more recent publications. (建议+理由, 2*2)

　　It would be greatly appreciated if those suggestions could be taken into account. Thank you for your time and consideration.

<div align="right"><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Li Ming　</p></div>
