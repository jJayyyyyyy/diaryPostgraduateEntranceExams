####	范文1: <2015年: 读书会，推荐一本书>

Dear friends,

　　There will be a club reading session at 5 p.m. next Saturday. Everyone will have a chance to share his or her favorite book. 

　　For my part, I can't wait to recommend a book named *The Moon and Sixpence* to you, which was written by W.S.Maugham. **To be honest, it's lucky for me to run into this book when I was wandering in the library.** The book depicts a story of a conventional stockbroker who abandons his family for Paris to live his life as a painter. Though his decision may seem weird, he finally achieves greatness.

　　**The novel is very informative and fascinating. Hopefully you will also enjoy this book.**

####	范文2: <推荐一首歌>

Dear friends,

　　There will be a music festival next week in our university. Here for the warm-up, I hope that everyone could post your favorite song on our website.

　　As for me, I can't wait to recommend *Sugar*, which is recorded by pop rock band Maroon 5 for their fifth studio album. With a vivid rhyme, it is a song that features a wide range of instruments including percussion(打击乐器), keyboards and guitars. There is also an interesting MV, in which they went into a real wedding and showed up as a great surprise to all attendance.

　　The song is very fascinating. Hopefully you will also enjoy it.
