Dear friends,

　　There will be a club reading session **at 5 p.m. next Saturday**. Everyone will have a chance to share his or her favorite book. 

　　For my part, I can't wait to recommend a book named *The Moon and Sixpence* to you, which was written by W.S.Maugham. **To be honest, it's lucky for me to run into this book when I was wandering in the library.** The book depicts a story of a conventional stockbroker who abandons his family for Paris to live his life as a painter. Though his decision seems weird, he finally achieves greatness.

　　**The novel is very informative and fascinating. Hopefully you will also enjoy this book.**

<div align="right"><p>Yours faithfully,</p><p>Li Ming　</p></div>

*	如果是私人信函，可以加入一些非正式用语，比如缩写，口头语

Dear Jack,

　　How are you doing recently? I ran into a really wonderful film a couple of days ago. And I am writing this letter to recommend it --- Around the World in Eighty Days.

　　**The primary reasons** are as follows. **Firstly,** this is a science fiction moive which tells us an exciting story about an English gentleman. In the story, he makes a bet with his clubmates that he can travel around the world in eighty days. **Secondly,** the film has vividly depicted the adventure of his journey, which is full of difficulties and excitments.

　　**I hope that you will have a chance to watch this movie and enjoy it. Looking forward to your reply.**

####	范文3: <推荐一首歌>

Dear friends,

　　There will be a music festival **next week in our university**. Here for the warming up, I hope that everyone could post your favorite song on our website.

　　As for me, I can't wait to recommend a song named *Sugar*, which is recorded by pop rock band Maroon 5. **Firstly,** it is a song that is characterized by a wide range of instruments with a vivid rhyme. **Secondly,** there is also an interesting music video, in which they go into a real wedding and show up as a great surprise to all the attendance.

　　**I hope that you will also enjoy this fascinating melody and share your feelings with us.**
