##	P163, 2016真题，两代关系，父母应当以身作则

####	第一段description，注意，这里有两幅图，所以drawings用复数

*	**It is subtly illustrated in the drawings that** a child and his father are in the living room. (总体描述)

*	**The first picture shows that** a smoking father who lies on a sofa and watches TV is asking his son to study hard. **On the contrary, the second** father is learning diligently together with his son, with stacks of books on both desks. (人物穿着、动作，状态，场景细节)

*	**Then it is captioned below, which suggests that** it is better to behave as a good model than just make a command. (翻译图中文字，或者换个方式表达)

<br/>

####	第二段, interpret, why, 客观原因、现象。 感性到理性, 一层抽象

*	**What can be inferred from the picture is that** some parents fail to get enough score in terms of family education, **the reasons of which can be various.** (你推出的 **客观** 结论，论点。为此你需要进行论证，举2个例子，说明为什么会出现上述情况)

*	**For instance**, not all parents are aware of the fact that their behavior might have a great impact on their offspring. **Unfortunately,** all parents more or less have some bad habits, such as smoking or swearing, which may lead to a disappointing outcome. (举例论证)

*	**Another reason is that** parents nowadays are fully occupied with their job. **As a result**, they are too tired to have enough energy to study with their children when returning home. **Even worse** is that lots of parents like watching TV as a way of relaxation. It is impossible, **however,** for children to concentrate on their homework in this condition with all that noise around. (举例论证)

*	**Therefore**, although parents are the first teachers, not all of them are good ones. (**段尾小结，呼应段首，基本上就是换个说法把第一句再说一遍**)

<br/>

####	第三段, your comments, (1.你对这种现象的态度, 2.解决方案), 最后一句展望、感叹

*	**In my personal view**, parents should **pay much more attention** in the presence of their children and set a good model to them. (你的**主观态度/看法**)

*	**Hence it is a better idea to** read some books with children **instead of** turning on the TV. **Moreover,** parents should try to give up their bad habits. (解决方案，针对你所举的两个例子，分别给出相应解法)

*	**Family and children are always the first priority. Only when you put your words into effort (practice what you preach) will you get a good result.** (强调，展望，etc，收尾点题)

<br/>
