##	P167, 两代关系，孩子的自立问题

####	第一段description，不要花费太多时间。字数控制在50以内，也就是差不多5行，否则二三段不够用了。

<br/>

*	**It is subtly illustrated in the drawing that** a family is walking around. (总体描述)

*	**The image shows that** the white-haired parents are looking after their adult son, who lies comfortably in a baby carriage. (人物穿着、动作，状态，场景细节，不要带主观情感)

*	**Then it is captioned below which suggests:** "Self-independence." (翻译图中文字，或者换个方式表达)

<br/><br/>

####	第二段, interpret, 客观原因、现象。 然后是why，为什么会出现这种情况，进行举例论证

<br/>

*	**What can be inferred from the picture is that** many young people rely heavily on their parents, the reasons of which can be various. (你推出的 **客观** 结论，论点。为此你需要进行论证，举2个例子，说明为什么会出现上述情况)

*	**关键点：进行举例论证，和对比论证，打草稿的时候要列出来**

    图中展现了父母和孩子，那就从这两方面举例论证。1).父母溺爱，或者没有提前意识到培养孩子独立性的重要性。2).孩子自己的问题，比如沉迷网络，不愿接触现实。

*	**For instance**, lots of families have only one child, who is carefully cherished and protected from the outside world. **As we all know**, animals that are isolated in the zoo for too long will be unable to survive in the wild. **Likewise,** children who have been long under the shelter of their parents will lose the capacity to face the society. (举例论证，对比论证)

*	**Another reason is that** many yound people **are fully occupied with** the virtual world of Internet, where they can get rid of the toughness of the reality. (举例论证)

*	**As a result**, their original ability of self-reliance gradually become rusty. (**段尾小结，呼应段首，基本上就是换个说法把第一句再说一遍**)

<br/><br/>

####	第三段, your comments, (1.你对这种现象的态度, 2.解决方案), 最后一句展望、感叹

<br/>

*	**In my personal view, much more attention should be paid** to help young people to stand on their feet. (你的**主观态度/看法**)

*   **Therefore** more internship opportunities should be provided for young people so that they can get used to the pace of society. (精简版的解决方案)

*	**Only in this way can they integrate into the society more efficiently and have a brighter future.** (强调，展望，etc，收尾点题)

<br/><br/>

####	补充

*	not all parents are aware of the importance to cultivate the independence of their child.

*	that their behavior might have a great impact on their offspring.

*	with their private network.

*   be isolated/kept from

*   keep up with / get accustomed to / get used to

*   original/intrinsic/instinctive

*	**Hence it is a better idea** for them to take part in more practical social activities **instead of** staying at home. **Moreover,** more internship experience should be provided for young people so that they can get used to the pace of society. (解决方案，针对你所举的两个例子，分别给出相应解法) (PS: 太长了，换成精简版，一个解决方案就够了，或者两个写到一起)
